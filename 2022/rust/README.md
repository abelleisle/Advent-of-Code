# 2022 Advent of Code

These are my 2022 Advent of Code solutions in Rust!

I'm using this year to learn Rust more, so my solutions aren't going to be top-notch.
Also, keep in mind that I try to solve these challenges in a time sensitive manner, so my code won't be production quality, and it absolutely relies on the provided input containing no errors.

I may go back and improve performance over time, but when I'm "competing", it's not my first priority.

# Usage

* To run all days, you can use the following command: `cargo run`
* To run a specific day, you can use the following: `cargo run <day>`
